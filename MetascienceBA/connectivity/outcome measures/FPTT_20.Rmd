This does not really work. Go to the next chunk. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#how many of them got there
test <- df %>%
  group_by(replica, population, network, sigma) %>%
  summarize(hit15 = ifelse(max(proportion_true >= 0.15), 1, 0))

#percentage of runs got to 50
test1 <- test %>%
  group_by(population, network, sigma) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(hit15))

#tallying up how many of misses and hits to 50%
test2 <- test %>%
  group_by(population, network, hit15, sigma) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

#first time to true model at 50%
df_fttm <- df %>%
  group_by(replica, population, network, sigma, true_model) %>%
  mutate(hit15 = ifelse(max(proportion_true >= 0.12), 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(hit15 == 1) %>%
  summarize(first_hit15 = min(which(proportion_true >= 0.12)))

#summary of first time to to 50%
df_fttm_sum <- df_fttm %>% 
  group_by(population, network) %>%
  summarise(median = median(first_hit15), 
            IQR = IQR(first_hit15))


```

by individual agents 

```{r}

#first way 
by_agent <- df %>%
  group_by(replica, population, network, sigma, true_model) %>%
  summarize(obtained = min(which(selected_true_model == 1 & 
                                final_global_true_model == 1)))


#second way
testing <- df %>%
  mutate(obtained = ifelse(selected_true_model == 1 & 
                             final_global_true_model == 1, 1, 0))
  
testing1 <- testing %>%
  group_by(replica, population, network, sigma, true_model) %>%
  summarize(first = min(which((obtained == 1))))

#are they the same?
all(by_agent == testing1)  

#summarized 
sum <- by_agent %>%
  group_by(network, population) %>%
  summarize(FPTT_mean = mean(obtained),
            FPTT_median = median(obtained),
            FPTT_IQR = IQR(obtained),
            FPTT_SD = sd(obtained))

```

write csv. 

```{r}

setwd("C:/Users/victm/Dropbox/CogSci 4/Social and Cultural Dynamics in Cognition/exam/CRUST-1/connectivity/outcome_results/sample_size_20")
getwd()

write.csv(sum, "FPTT_small_20.csv", row.names = F)
rm(list = ls())

```

read csv (to check)

```{r}

read.csv("FPTT_small_20.csv")

```
