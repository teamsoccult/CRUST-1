```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

getting the maximum distance between the maximum and the minimum proportion when the first of them is the positive one

```{r}
small_epi_0.2 <- read.csv("~/CRUST-1/data/rfs50/small_epi_0.2_BIC_100_hard_100.csv", sep=";")

small_epi_0.2$timestep < small_epi_0.2$timestep #logical operater needed to check whether or not the first timestep is before the other



test_stick <- min(small_epi_0.2[1000:11000,31]) #should there be a subset?

optimum_before <- max(small_epi_0.2[1000:11000,31])


stick <- small_epi_0.2 %>%
  group_by(replica) %>%
  summarise(peaks = (findpeaks(proportion_7)[,1]))

check <- findpeaks(small_epi_0.2$proportion_7)

check <- as.data.frame(check)

str(check)
```
